# Search in Rotated Sorted Array

## Description

&emsp;&emsp;Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.
            
&emsp;&emsp;(i.e., **\[0,1,2,4,5,6,7\]** might become **\[4,5,6,7,0,1,2\]**).
            
&emsp;&emsp;You are given a target value to search. If found in the array return its index, otherwise return **-1**.
            
&emsp;&emsp;You may assume no duplicate exists in the array.
            
&emsp;&emsp;Your algorithm's runtime complexity must be in the order of O(log n).
            
## Example:

### eg1

```
    Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0
    
    Output: 4
```

### eg2

```
    Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 3
    
    Output: -1
```
