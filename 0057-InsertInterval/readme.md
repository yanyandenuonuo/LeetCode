# Insert Interval

## Description

&emsp;&emsp;Given a set of non-overlapping intervals, insert a new interval into the intervals \(merge if necessary\).
            
&emsp;&emsp;You may assume that the intervals were initially sorted according to their start times.
            
## Example:

### eg1

```
    Input: intervals = [[1,3],[6,9]], newInterval = [2,5]
    
    Output: [[1,5],[6,9]]
```

### eg2

```
    Input: intervals = [[1,2],[3,5],[6,7],[8,10],[12,16]], newInterval = [4,8]
    
    Output: [[1,2],[3,10],[12,16]]
    
    Explanation: Because the new interval [4,8] overlaps with [3,5],[6,7],[8,10].
