# Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock IV

## Description

&emsp;&emsp;Say you have an array for which the i^th element is the price of a given stock on day i.

&emsp;&emsp;Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete at most **k** transactions.

## Note

&emsp;&emsp;You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time \(ie, you must sell the stock before you buy 
again\).

## Example

### eg1

```
    Input: [2,4,1], k = 2
    
    Output: 2
    
    Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 2) and sell on day 2 (price = 4), profit = 4-2 = 2.
```

### eg2

```
    Input: [3,2,6,5,0,3], k = 2
    
    Output: 7
    
    Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 2) and sell on day 3 (price = 6), profit = 6-2 = 4.
                 Then buy on day 5 (price = 0) and sell on day 6 (price = 3), profit = 3-0 = 3.
