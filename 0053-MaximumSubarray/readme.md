# Maximum Subarray

## Description

&emsp;&emsp;Given an integer array **nums**, find the contiguous subarray \(containing at least one number\) which has 
the largest sum and return its sum.

## Example:

### eg1

```
    Input: [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4],
    
    Output: 6
    
    Explanation: [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum = 6.
```

## Follow up

&emsp;&emsp;If you have figured out the O\(n\) solution, try coding another solution using the divide and conquer 
approach, which is more subtle.
