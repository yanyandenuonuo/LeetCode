# Unique Paths

## Description

&emsp;&emsp;A robot is located at the top-left corner of a m x n grid \(marked 'Start' in the diagram below\).
            
&emsp;&emsp;The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the 
bottom-right corner of the grid \(marked 'Finish' in the diagram below\).
            
&emsp;&emsp;How many possible unique paths are there?

&emsp;&emsp;Above is a 7 x 3 grid. How many possible unique paths are there?

&emsp;&emsp;**Note:** m and n will be at most 100.
            
## Example:

### eg1

```
    Input: m = 3, n = 2
    
    Output: 3
    
    Explanation:
    From the top-left corner, there are a total of 3 ways to reach the bottom-right corner:
    1. Right -> Right -> Down
    2. Right -> Down -> Right
    3. Down -> Right -> Right
```

### eg2

```
    Input: m = 7, n = 3
    
    Output: 28
```
