# Two Sum

## Description

&emsp;&emsp;Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

&emsp;&emsp;You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

## Example:

``` 
    Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,
    
    Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
    
    return [0, 1].
```
