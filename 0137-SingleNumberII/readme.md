# Single Number II

## Description

&emsp;&emsp;Given a **non-empty** array of integers, every element appears three times except for one, which appears 
exactly once. Find that single one.

## Note

&emsp;&emsp;Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?

## Example

### eg1

```
    Input: [2,2,3,2]
    
    Output: 3
```

### eg2

```
    Input: [0,1,0,1,0,1,99]
    
    Output: 99
```
