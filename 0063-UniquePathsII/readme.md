# Unique Paths II

## Description

&emsp;&emsp;A robot is located at the top-left corner of a m x n grid \(marked 'Start' in the diagram below\).
            
&emsp;&emsp;The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the 
bottom-right corner of the grid \(marked 'Finish' in the diagram below\).
            
&emsp;&emsp;Now consider if some obstacles are added to the grids. How many unique paths would there be?

&emsp;&emsp;An obstacle and empty space is marked as **1** and **0** respectively in the grid.

&emsp;&emsp;**Note:** m and n will be at most 100.
            
## Example:

### eg1

```
    Input:
    [
        [0,0,0],
        [0,1,0],
        [0,0,0]
    ]
    
    Output: 2
    
    Explanation:
    There is one obstacle in the middle of the 3x3 grid above.
    There are two ways to reach the bottom-right corner:
    1. Right -> Right -> Down -> Down
    2. Down -> Down -> Right -> Right
