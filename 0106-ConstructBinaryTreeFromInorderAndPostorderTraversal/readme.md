# Construct Binary Tree from Inorder and Postorder Traversal

## Description

&emsp;&emsp;Given inorder and postorder traversal of a tree, construct the binary tree.

## Note

&emsp;&emsp;You may assume that duplicates do not exist in the tree.

## Example

### eg1

&emsp;&emsp;For example, given

```
    inorder = [9,3,15,20,7]
    
    postorder = [9,15,7,20,3]
```

```
        3
       / \
      9  20
