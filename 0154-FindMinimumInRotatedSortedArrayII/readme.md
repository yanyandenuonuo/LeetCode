# Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array II

## Description

&emsp;&emsp;Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.

&emsp;&emsp;\(i.e.,  **\[0,1,2,4,5,6,7\]** might become **\[4,5,6,7,0,1,2\]**\).

&emsp;&emsp;Find the minimum element.

&emsp;&emsp;The array may contain duplicates.

## Example

### eg1

```
    Input: [1,3,5]
    
    Output: 1
```

### eg2

```
    Input: [2,2,2,0,1]
    
    Output: 0
```

## Note

- This is a follow up problem to Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array.
- Would allow duplicates affect the run-time complexity? How and why?
