# Minimum Depth of Binary Tree

## Description

&emsp;&emsp;Given a binary tree, find its minimum depth.

&emsp;&emsp;The minimum depth is the number of nodes along the shortest path from the root node down to the nearest 
leaf node.

&emsp;&emsp;**Note:** A leaf is a node with no children.

## Example

### eg1

&emsp;&emsp;Given binary tree **\[3,9,20,null,null,15,7\]**,

```
        3
       / \
      9  20
        /  \
       15   7
```

&emsp;&emsp;return its minimum depth = 2.
