# Triangle

## Description

&emsp;&emsp;Given a triangle, find the minimum path sum from top to bottom. Each step you may move to adjacent numbers 
on the row below.

## Example

### eg1

&emsp;&emsp;For example, given the following triangle

```
    [
         [2],
        [3,4],
       [6,5,7],
      [4,1,8,3]
    ]
```

&emsp;&emsp;The minimum path sum from top to bottom is **11** \(i.e., **2 + 3 + 5 + 1** \= 11\).

## Note

&emsp;&emsp;Bonus point if you are able to do this using only O\(n\) extra space, where n is the total number of rows 
in the triangle.

## Difficulty

&emsp;&emsp;Medium
