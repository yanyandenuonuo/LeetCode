&emsp;&emsp;Given an integer n, return all distinct solutions to the n-queens puzzle.
            
&emsp;&emsp;Each solution contains a distinct board configuration of the n-queens' placement, where **'Q'** and 
**'\.'** both indicate a queen and an empty space respectively.

            "Q...",
            "..Q."
        ], [
            "..Q.",     // Solution 2
            "Q...",
            "...Q",
            ".Q.."
        ]
