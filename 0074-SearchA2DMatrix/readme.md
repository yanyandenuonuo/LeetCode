# Search a 2D Matrix

## Description

&emsp;&emsp;Write an efficient algorithm that searches for a value in an m x n matrix. This matrix has the following 
properties:

- Integers in each row are sorted from left to right.
- The first integer of each row is greater than the last integer of the previous row.
            
## Example:

### eg1

```
    Input:
    matrix = [
        [1,   3,  5,  7],
        [10, 11, 16, 20],
        [23, 30, 34, 50]
    ]
    target = 3
    
    Output: true
```

### eg2

```
    Input:
    matrix = [
        [1,   3,  5,  7],
        [10, 11, 16, 20],
        [23, 30, 34, 50]
    ]
    target = 13
    
    Output: false
```
