# Reverse Nodes in k-Group

## Description

&emsp;&emsp;Given a linked list, reverse the nodes of a linked list k at a time and return its modified list.
            
&emsp;&emsp;k is a positive integer and is less than or equal to the length of the linked list. If the number of nodes 
is not a multiple of k then left-out nodes in the end should remain as it is.
            
## Example:

### eg1

&emsp;&emsp;Given this linked list: **1->2->3->4->5**

&emsp;&emsp;For k = 2, you should return: **2->1->4->3->5**

&emsp;&emsp;For k = 3, you should return: **3->2->1->4->5**

## Note

- Only constant extra memory is allowed.
- You may not alter the values in the list's nodes, only nodes itself may be changed.
