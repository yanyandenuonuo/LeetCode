# Next Permutation

## Description

&emsp;&emsp;Implement **next permutation*, which rearranges numbers into the lexicographically next greater permutation 
of numbers.
            
&emsp;&emsp;If such arrangement is not possible, it must rearrange it as the lowest possible order (ie, sorted in 
ascending order).
            
&emsp;&emsp;The replacement must be **in-place** and use only constant extra memory.
            
&emsp;&emsp;Here are some examples. Inputs are in the left-hand column and its corresponding outputs are in the 
right-hand column.

```
    1,2,3 → 1,3,2
    
    3,2,1 → 1,2,3
    
    1,1,5 → 1,5,1
```
