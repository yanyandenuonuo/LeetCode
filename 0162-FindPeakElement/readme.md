# Find Peak Element

## Description

&emsp;&emsp;A peak element is an element that is greater than its neighbors.

&emsp;&emsp;Given an input array **nums**, where **nums\[i\] ≠ nums\[i+1\]**, find a peak element and return its 
index.

&emsp;&emsp;The array may contain multiple peaks, in that case return the index to any one of the peaks is fine.

&emsp;&emsp;You may imagine that **nums\[-1\] = nums\[n\] = \-∞**.

## Example

### eg1

```
    Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
    
    Output: 2
    
    Explanation: 3 is a peak element and your function should return the index number 2.
```

### eg2

```
    Input: nums = [1,2,1,3,5,6,4]
    
    Output: 1 or 5 
    
    Explanation: Your function can return either index number 1 where the peak element is 2, 
                 or index number 5 where the peak element is 6.
```

## Note

&emsp;&emsp;Your solution should be in logarithmic complexity.
