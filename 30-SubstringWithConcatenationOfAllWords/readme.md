# Substring with Concatenation of All Words

## Description

&emsp;&emsp;You are given a string, **s**, and a list of **words**, words, that are all of the same length. Find all 
starting indices of substring(s) in **s** that is a concatenation of each word in **words** exactly once and without 
any intervening characters.
            
## Example:

### eg1

```
    Input:
        s = "barfoothefoobarman",
        words = ["foo","bar"]
        
    Output: [0,9]
    
    Explanation: Substrings starting at index 0 and 9 are "barfoor" and "foobar" respectively.
    The output order does not matter, returning [9,0] is fine too.
```

### eg2

```
    Input:
        s = "wordgoodstudentgoodword",
        words = ["word","student"]
        
    Output: []
```
