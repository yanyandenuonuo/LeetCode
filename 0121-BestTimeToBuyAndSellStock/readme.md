# Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock

## Description

&emsp;&emsp;Say you have an array for which the i^th element is the price of a given stock on day i.

&emsp;&emsp;If you were only permitted to complete at most one transaction \(i.e., buy one and sell one share of the 
stock\), design an algorithm to find the maximum profit.

&emsp;&emsp;Note that you cannot sell a stock before you buy one.

## Example

### eg1

```
    Input: [7,1,5,3,6,4]
    
    Output: 5
    
    Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
                 Not 7-1 = 6, as selling price needs to be larger than buying price.
```

### eg2

```
    Input: [7,6,4,3,1]
    
    Output: 0
    
    Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.
