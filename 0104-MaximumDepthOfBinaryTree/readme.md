# Maximum Depth of Binary Tree

## Description

&emsp;&emsp;Given a binary tree, find its maximum depth.

&emsp;&emsp;The maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest 
leaf node.

&emsp;&emsp;**Note:** A leaf is a node with no children.


## Example

### eg1

&emsp;&emsp;Given binary tree **\[3,9,20,null,null,15,7\]**,

```
        3
       / \
      9  20
        /  \
       15   7
```

&emsp;&emsp;return its depth = 3.
