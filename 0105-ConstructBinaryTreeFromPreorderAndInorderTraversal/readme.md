# Construct Binary Tree from Preorder and Inorder Traversal

## Description

&emsp;&emsp;Given preorder and inorder traversal of a tree, construct the binary tree.

## Note

&emsp;&emsp;You may assume that duplicates do not exist in the tree.

## Example

### eg1

&emsp;&emsp;For example, given

```
    preorder = [3,9,20,15,7]
    
    inorder = [9,3,15,20,7]
```

&emsp;&emsp;Return the following binary tree:

```
        3
       / \
      9  20
        /  \
       15   7
