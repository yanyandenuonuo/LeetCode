# Reverse Words in a String

## Description

&emsp;&emsp;Given an input string, reverse the string word by word.

## Example

### eg1

```
    Input: "the sky is blue",
    
    Output: "blue is sky the".
```

## Note
    
- A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters.
- Input string may contain leading or trailing spaces. However, your reversed string should not contain leading or 
trailing spaces.
- You need to reduce multiple spaces between two words to a single space in the reversed string.
