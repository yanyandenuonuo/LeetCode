# Reverse Integer

## Description

&emsp;&emsp;Determine whether an integer is a palindrome. An integer is a palindrome when it reads the same backward 
as forward.

## Example:

### eg1

``` 
    Input: 121
    
    Output: true
```

### eg2

``` 
    Input: -121
    
    Output: false
    
    Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a 
                    palindrome.
```

### eg3

``` 
    Input: 10
    
    Output: false
    
    Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
```
