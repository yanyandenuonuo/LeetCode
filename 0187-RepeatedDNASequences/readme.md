# Repeated DNA Sequences

## Description

&emsp;&emsp;All DNA is composed of a series of nucleotides abbreviated as A, C, G, and T, for example: "ACGAATTCCG". 
When studying DNA, it is sometimes useful to identify repeated sequences within the DNA.

&emsp;&emsp;Write a function to find all the 10-letter-long sequences \(substrings\) that occur more than once in a DNA 
molecule.

## Example

### eg1

```
    Input: s = "AAAAACCCCCAAAAACCCCCCAAAAAGGGTTT"
    
    Output: ["AAAAACCCCC", "CCCCCAAAAA"]
```
