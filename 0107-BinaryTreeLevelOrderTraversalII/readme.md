# Binary Tree Level Order Traversal II

## Description

&emsp;&emsp;Given a binary tree, return the bottom-up level order traversal of its nodes' values. \(ie, from left to 
right, level by level from leaf to root\).

## Example

### eg1

&emsp;&emsp;For example, Given binary tree \[3,9,20,null,null,15,7\],

```
        3
       / \
      9  20
        /  \
       15   7
```

&emsp;&emsp;return its bottom-up level order traversal as:

```
    [
        [15,7],
        [9,20],
        [3]
    ]
```
