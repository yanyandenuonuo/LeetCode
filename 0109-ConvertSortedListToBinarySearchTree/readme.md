# Convert Sorted List to Binary Search Tree

## Description

&emsp;&emsp;Given a singly linked list where elements are sorted in ascending order, convert it to a height balanced BST.

&emsp;&emsp;For this problem, a height-balanced binary tree is defined as a binary tree in which the depth of the two 
subtrees of every node never differ by more than 1.

## Example

### eg1

```
    Given the sorted linked list: [-10,-3,0,5,9],
    
    One possible answer is: [0,-3,9,-10,null,5], which represents the following height balanced BST:
    
          0
         / \
       -3   9
       /   /
     -10  5
```
