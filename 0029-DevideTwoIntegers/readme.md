# Divide Two Integers

## Description

&emsp;&emsp;Given two integers **dividend** and **divisor**, divide two integers without using multiplication, 
division and mod operator.
            
&emsp;&emsp;Return the quotient after dividing **dividend** by **divisor**.
            
&emsp;&emsp;The integer division should truncate toward zero.

## Example:

### eg1

```
    Input: dividend = 10, divisor = 3
    
    Output: 3
```

### eg2

```
    Input: dividend = 7, divisor = -3
    
    Output: -2
```

## Note

- Both dividend and divisor will be 32-bit signed integers.
- The divisor will never be 0.
- Assume we are dealing with an environment which could only store integers within the 32-bit signed integer range: 
\[−2^31,  2^31 − 1\]. For the purpose of this problem, assume that your function returns 2^31 − 1 when the division 
result overflows.
