# Count and Say

## Description

&emsp;&emsp;The count-and-say sequence is the sequence of integers with the first five terms as following:
            
```
    1.     1
    2.     11
    3.     21
    4.     1211
    5.     111221
```

&emsp;&emsp;**1** is read off as **"one 1"** or **11**.

&emsp;&emsp;**11** is read off as **"two 1s"** or **21**.

&emsp;&emsp;**21** is read off as **"one 2**, then **one 1"** or **1211**.

&emsp;&emsp;Given an integer n, generate the n^th term of the count-and-say sequence.

&emsp;&emsp;Note: Each term of the sequence of integers will be represented as a string.

## Example:

### eg1

```
    Input: 1
    
    Output: "1"
```

### eg2

```
