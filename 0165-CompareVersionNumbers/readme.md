# Compare Version Numbers

## Description

&emsp;&emsp;Compare two version numbers version1 and version2.

&emsp;&emsp;If **version1 \> version2** return **1**; if **version1 \< version2** return **\-1**;otherwise return 
**0**.
            
&emsp;&emsp;You may assume that the version strings are non-empty and contain only digits and the **\.** character.

&emsp;&emsp;The **\.** character does not represent a decimal point and is used to separate number sequences.

&emsp;&emsp;For instance, **2\.5** is not "two and a half" or "half way to version three", it is the fifth 
second\-level revision of the second first\-level revision.

## Example

### eg
```
    Input: version1 = "0.1", version2 = "1.1"
    
    Output: -1
```

### eg2

```
    Input: version1 = "1.0.1", version2 = "1"
    
    Output: 1
```

### eg3

```
    Input: version1 = "7.5.2.4", version2 = "7.5.3"
    
    Output: -1
```
