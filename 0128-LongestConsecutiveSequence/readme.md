# Longest Consecutive Sequence

## Description

&emsp;&emsp;Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

&emsp;&emsp;Your algorithm should run in O\(n\) complexity.

## Example

### eg1

```
    Input: [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2]
    
    Output: 4
    
    Explanation: The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore its length is 4.
