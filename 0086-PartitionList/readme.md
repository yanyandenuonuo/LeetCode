# Partition List

## Description

&emsp;&emsp;Given a linked list and a value x, partition it such that all nodes less than x come before nodes greater 
than or equal to x.
            
&emsp;&emsp;You should preserve the original relative order of the nodes in each of the two partitions.
            
## Example

### eg1

```
    Input: head = 1->4->3->2->5->2, x = 3
