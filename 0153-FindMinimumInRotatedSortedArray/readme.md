# Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array

## Description

&emsp;&emsp;Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.

&emsp;&emsp;\(i.e.,  **\[0,1,2,4,5,6,7\]** might become **\[4,5,6,7,0,1,2\]**\).

&emsp;&emsp;Find the minimum element.

&emsp;&emsp;You may assume no duplicate exists in the array.

## Example

### eg1

```
    Input: [3,4,5,1,2] 
    
    Output: 1
```

### eg2

```
    Input: [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]
    
    Output: 0
```
