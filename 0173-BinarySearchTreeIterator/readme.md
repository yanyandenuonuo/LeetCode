# Binary Search Tree Iterator

## Description

&emsp;&emsp;Implement an iterator over a binary search tree \(BST\). Your iterator will be initialized with the root 
node of a BST.

&emsp;&emsp;Calling next\(\) will return the next smallest number in the BST.

## Note

&emsp;&emsp;**next\(\)** and **hasNext\(\)** should run in average O\(1\) time and uses O\(h\) memory, where h is the 
height of the tree.
