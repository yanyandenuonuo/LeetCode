# Search in Rotated Sorted Array II

## Description

&emsp;&emsp;Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.

&emsp;&emsp;\(i.e., **\[0,0,1,2,2,5,6\]** might become **\[2,5,6,0,0,1,2\]**\).

&emsp;&emsp;You are given a target value to search. If found in the array return **true**, otherwise return **false**.
            
## Example

### eg1

```
    Input: nums = [2,5,6,0,0,1,2], target = 0
    
    Output: true
```

### eg2

```
    Input: nums = [2,5,6,0,0,1,2], target = 3
    
    Output: false
```

## Follow up
   
- This is a follow up problem to **Search in Rotated Sorted Array**, where **nums** may contain duplicates.
- Would this affect the run-time complexity? How and why?
