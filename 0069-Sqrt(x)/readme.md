# Sqrt\(x\)

## Description

&emsp;&emsp;Implement **int sqrt\(int x\)**.

&emsp;&emsp;Compute and return the square root of x, where x is guaranteed to be a non-negative integer.

&emsp;&emsp;Since the return type is an integer, the decimal digits are truncated and only the integer part of the 
result is returned.

## Example:

### eg1

```
    Input: 4
    
    Output: 2
```

### eg2

```
    Input: 8
    
    Output: 2
    Explanation: The square root of 8 is 2.82842..., and since 
                 the decimal part is truncated, 2 is returned.
```
