# Median of Two Sorted Arrays

## Description

&emsp;&emsp;There are two sorted arrays **nums1** and **nums2** of size m and n respectively.

&emsp;&emsp;Find the median of the two sorted arrays. The overall run time complexity should be O(log (m+n)).

## Example:

### eg1

``` 
    nums1 = [1, 3]
    
    nums2 = [2]

    The median is 2.0
```

### eg2

``` 
    nums1 = [1, 2]
    
    nums2 = [3, 4]
    
    The median is (2 + 3)/2 = 2.5
```
