# Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II

## Description

&emsp;&emsp;Say you have an array for which the i^th element is the price of a given stock on day i.

&emsp;&emsp;Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete as many transactions as you like \(i.e., 
buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times\).

&emsp;&emsp;**Note:** You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time \(i.e., you must sell the stock 
before you buy again\).

## Example

### eg1

```
    Input: [7,1,5,3,6,4]
    
    Output: 7
    
    Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 3 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
                 Then buy on day 4 (price = 3) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-3 = 3.
```

### eg2

```
    Input: [1,2,3,4,5]
    
    Output: 4
    
    Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
                 Note that you cannot buy on day 1, buy on day 2 and sell them later, as you are
                 engaging multiple transactions at the same time. You must sell before buying again.
```

### eg3

```
    Input: [7,6,4,3,1]
    
    Output: 0
    
    Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.
