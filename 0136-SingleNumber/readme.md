# Single Number

## Description

&emsp;&emsp;Given a **non-empty** array of integers, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

## Note

&emsp;&emsp;Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?

## Example

### eg1

```
    Input: [2,2,1]
    
    Output: 1
```

### eg2

```
    Input: [4,1,2,1,2]
    
    Output: 4
```
