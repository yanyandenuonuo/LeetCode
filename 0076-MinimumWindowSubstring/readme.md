# Minimum Window Substring

## Description

&emsp;&emsp;Given a string S and a string T, find the minimum window in S which will contain all the characters in T in 
complexity O\(n\).
            
## Example

### eg1

```
    Input: S = "ADOBECODEBANC", T = "ABC"
    
    Output: "BANC"
```

## Note
   
- If there is no such window in S that covers all characters in T, return the empty string **"&ensp;"**.
- If there is such window, you are guaranteed that there will always be only one unique minimum window in S.
